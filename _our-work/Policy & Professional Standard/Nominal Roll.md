<h4><strong>Nominal Roll</strong></h4>
<p>UPEC maintains a nominal roll of qualified paramedics and EMTs. This list
tracks their certifications and professional details, serving as a record
of all recognised paramedics and EMTs. It ensures they meet the necessary
standards and qualifications to provide emergency medical services. Although
not a formal registry, the nominal roll helps verify the credentials of
paramedics and EMTs, and promotes professionalism within the field.</p>
<h4><strong>Pre-hospital Provider e-cards</strong></h4>
<p>The e-cards are digital identification cards issued to personnel listed
on the nominal roll, providing a convenient and professional way to verify
the qualifications and status of paramedics and EMTs. Each e-card includes
essential information such as the paramedic's name, the card's expiry date,
and a unique identification number that follows the paramedic or EMT, similar
to an IC number. These e-cards enhance the personnel's credibility and
facilitate quick verification of their credentials. To remain valid, these
e-cards need to be renewed 3 to 6 months before expiration, with early
renewal encouraged to avoid last-minute delays.</p>
<p>For verification of paramedics' or EMTs' qualification status, please
