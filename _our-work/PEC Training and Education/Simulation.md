<p>Simulation as a mean of training in a safe and controlled environment
has become more common in the field of pre-hospital emergency care.</p>
<p>UPEC staff and physicians work closely with SCDF paramedic educators to
create/ simulation situation or environment that allow paramedics to practise,
learn, evaluate and test existing/new knowledge and skills. It also helps
the paramedic crews to foster teamwork and gain understanding of systems/team
dynamics.</p>
<p>UPEC and SEMS collaborated in the organising of EMS SIMWars. UPEC also
helps SAF and SCDF paramedics to prepare for competitions like the international
Ferno Australia Paramedic Simulation. The paramedic teams have participated
since 2014, and SCDF team came in as the 1st runner-up in the same year.</p>
