### Establishment of UPEC

World-class healthcare must include a world-class pre-hospital emergency care system. Pre-hospital emergency care (PEC) is the provision of emergency medical care in a pre- or out-of-hospital setting, to an acutely ill or injured patient.

It is a uniquely time-sensitive domain of healthcare where early recognition and intervention have profound impact on patient outcome.

In February 2013, the Unit for Pre-hospital Emergency Care (UPEC) was established by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to coordinate, monitor and implement the various PEC strategies, as well as to provide clinical and operational oversight.

Our vision is to establish a world-class PEC system, readily accessible to all, and provide excellent patient outcomes.
