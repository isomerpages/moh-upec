<p>“Towards a World Class Pre-hospital Emergency Care System for Singapore”
has always been UPEC’s motto since the day of its commencement. Our goal
is to implement world class EMS training that will align with hospital
standards and better serve patients’ increasingly complex needs.</p>
<p>Apart from a group of dedicated Emergency Medicine physicians, we have
worked hand in hand with other stakeholders, such as SCDF, SMTI and paramedic
training institutions, to enhance the quality of training and education
for paramedics.</p>
