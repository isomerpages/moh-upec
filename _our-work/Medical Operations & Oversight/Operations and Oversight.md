# Medical Operations and Oversight

Medical Operations and Oversight for emergency medical service (EMS) systems encompasses all aspects of medical care provided in the pre-hospital setting and its oversight.  
  
From the moment of the point of first contact, the medical operations begin during the call to 995, followed by the response by the emergency responders, the care of the patient at the scene and subsequently en route to the destination facility. Medical oversight is provided through the development and regular review of clinical protocols for offline medical direction, as well as through real-time communications with emergency response personnel for direct online medical direction.
