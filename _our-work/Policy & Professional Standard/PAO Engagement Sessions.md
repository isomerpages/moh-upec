With the intended implementation for the Heathcare Services Act (HCSA) and introduction of 2017 EAS and MTS Standards, MOH and UPEC have conducted multiple engagements sessions with the PAOs to share the ambulance regulatory framework under HCSA and to gather feedback from the PAOs.  You may find the resources from the various PAO Engagements Sessions that have been conducted over the past years.
