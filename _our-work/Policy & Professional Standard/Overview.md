<p>The Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) was enacted on January 6, 2020, to
regulate healthcare services in Singapore. It replaces the Private Hospitals
and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA), allowing for a more adaptable approach
to regulating healthcare services beyond physical premises as new care
models and services develop. The HCSA provides regulatory clarity for service
providers, enhancing care provision and continuity for patients.</p>
<p>Under this new regulatory framework, all private ambulance services must
be licensed. Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs) must apply for an HCSA
license to provide either Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) or Medical
Transport Service (MTS).</p>
<p>To obtain the HCSA license, Emergency Ambulance Services (EAS) and Medical
Transport Services (MTS) must meet both general licensing requirements
applicable to all licensees and specific requirements for ambulances. After
meeting these criteria, they must apply to the Ministry of Health (MOH)
for vehicle inspections. The license will be granted upon passing the inspections.</p>
