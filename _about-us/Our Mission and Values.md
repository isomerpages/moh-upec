### Our Mission

*   _Collaboration_**:** A comprehensive PEC system must involve collaboration and participation of all relevant stakeholders in a far-sighted, coordinated manner.
*   _Evidence-base_**:** We will adopt PEC system changes that have an evidence-base or a reasonable basis for implementation in Singapore.
*   _Engaged communities_**:** We aim to achieve the best patient outcomes from early recognition and intervention.
*   _Empowerment_**:** Both volunteers and professional PEC personnel must be trained and empowered to bring early intervention in an out-of- hospital setting and into the community.

### Our Values

*   Develop a coherent and viable framework for inter-agency collaboration and coordination for the long-term development of PEC in Singapore;
*   Promote public responsiveness in pre-hospital emergencies;
*   Strengthen Singapore’s PEC services to world-class standards through training and continuous quality improvement;
*   Ensure that PEC is seamlessly integrated into the health care system; and
*   Create a supportive environment for pre-hospital emergency care research to improve health outcomes.
