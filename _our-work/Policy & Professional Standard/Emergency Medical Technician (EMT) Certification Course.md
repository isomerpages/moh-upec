Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are often the first responders at medical or trauma scenes, providing critical initial patient care. It is essential for EMTs to have the necessary skills and competencies to perform their duties effectively. According to the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA), Medical Transport Service (MTS) vehicles must be staffed with at least one certified EMT as the crew leader. Therefore, Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs) must ensure that their personnel have successfully completed EMT training and hold valid EMT certification.
