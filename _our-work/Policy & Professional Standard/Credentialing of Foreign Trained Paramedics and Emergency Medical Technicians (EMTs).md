<p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) has regulated private ambulance services
as either Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) or Medical Transport Service
(MTS), licensing them under the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) effective
January 3, 2022. The EAS and MTS regulations also specify staff requirements,
including recognized qualifications and certifications.</p>
<p>As part of these regulations, a credentialing framework has been established
to ensure that all EMTs and Paramedics, including those trained overseas,
meet the standards required to be recognised as qualified professionals
in Singapore. This framework allows these healthcare professionals to be
officially acknowledged and integrated into the local emergency medical
services system.</p>
<p>The eligibility criteria and requirements are outlined below:</p>
