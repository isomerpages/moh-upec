<h3>Operational Medical Network Informatics Integrators (OMNII)</h3>
<p>The project OMNII is a collaboration between MOH and MHA-SCDF to provide
seamless data sharing among the 995 Ops center, the ground ambulance team
and the hospitals’ emergency departments. UPEC co-chairs this project with
SCDF. We provide the project with clinical advice and operational inputs
from clinical perspectives.</p>
<p>Essential medical history of the patient will be provided to the paramedics
for more acute assessment and treatment. The pre-hospital care record will
be transmitted almost real time to the receiving emergency department for
early preparation and activation of other services. The emergency department
will also have an overall preview of the patients’ status, condition and
estimated arrival time for better resource management.</p>
