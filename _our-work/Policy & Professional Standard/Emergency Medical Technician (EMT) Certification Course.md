EMTs are among the first responders on a medical or trauma scene and help start the initial patient care. Thus, it is important for EMTs to possess the necessary competencies and skills to perform their role as a certified EMT. Under the MOH 2017 Standards for EAS and MTS, MTS vehicles are minimally required to be staffed by a certified EMT. As such, PAOs must ensure that their staff have successfully undergone the EMT training and possess valid certification in EMT.
