# **Policy & Professional Standards**

![](/images/Coverpage_picture.jpeg)Healthcare Services Act (HCSA), slated to be implemented in 2022, will be replacing the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PMHCA) where regulatory compliances go according to the nature and type of services provided over premise based licensing. More information about HCSA are available at this [link](https://www.moh.gov.sg/hcsa/home).

In the new regulatory framework, under HCSA, all private ambulance services will need to be licensed. The Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs) will be required to apply for a HCSA license in order to provide either Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) or Medical Transport Service (MTS).

UPEC is working closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop a set of relevant and updated standards for both EAS and MTS; that will be enforced under the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA).

Each vehicle must meet the licensing requirement and be issued with a Certificate of Compliance (COC). The issuance of the COC will supersede the current Letter of Support (LOS) Scheme. Vehicles issued with a COC will continue to enjoy tax exemptions.

### Requirements for Accreditation

We strongly encouraged existing and new Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs) to accredit their fleet as well as comply with the MOH 2017 Standards for Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) and Medical Transport Service (MTS). [2017 EAS Standards](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/moh-standards-for-emergency-ambulance-service-(2017)-updated-20-jan-2021) [2017 MTS Standards](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/moh-standards-for-medical-transport-service-(2017)-updated-20-jan-2021)

PAOs that are unable to meet the licensing requirements by the time regulations are enforced will not be able to provide EAS or MTS services.
