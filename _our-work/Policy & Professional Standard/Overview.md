<p>The Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) was enacted on January 6, 2020, to
regulate healthcare services in Singapore. It replaces the Private Hospitals
and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA), allowing for a more adaptable approach
to regulating healthcare services beyond physical premises as new care
models and services develop.</p>
<p>The HCSA provides regulatory clarity for service providers, enhancing
care provision and continuity for patients. Under this new regulatory framework,
all private ambulance services must be licensed. Private Ambulance Operators
(PAOs) must apply for an HCSA license to provide either Emergency Ambulance
Service (EAS) or Medical Transport Service (MTS).</p>
<p>To obtain the HCSA license, EAS and MTS must meet both general licensing
requirements, applicable to all licensees, and specific requirements for
ambulances. UPEC is collaborating closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH)
to establish updated standards for EAS and MTS, which will be enforced
under the HCSA.</p>
