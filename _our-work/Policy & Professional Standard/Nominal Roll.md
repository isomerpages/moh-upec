<p>UPEC maintains a nominal roll of qualified paramedics and EMTs. This list
tracks their certifications and professional details, serving as a record
of all recognised paramedics and EMTs. It ensures they meet the necessary
standards and qualifications to provide emergency medical services. Although
not a formal registry, the nominal roll helps verify the credentials of
paramedics and EMTs, and promotes professionalism within the field.</p>
<h4><strong>Pre-hospital Provider e-cards</strong></h4>
<p>The e-cards are digital identification cards issued to personnel listed
on the nominal roll. These e-cards provide a convenient and professional
way to verify the qualifications and status of paramedics and EMTs. Each
e-card includes essential information such as the paramedic's name, the
expiry date of the e-card, and a unique identification number that will
follow the paramedic or EMT like their IC number. These e-cards enhance
the credibility of the personnel and facilitate quick verification of their
credentials.</p>
