description: One of our key achievements was the collaboration between the
  Singapore Civil Defence Forces (SCDF) and MOH to emplace medical nurses in
  SCDF operations centre to assist on cardiac arrest calls. The influence of
  dispatch can also extend to the initiation of bystander cardiopulmonary
  resuscitation, early defibrillation and the rapid dispatch of emergency
  ambulance.  There was also successful implementation of Singapore’s
  dispatcher-assisted CPR protocol where dispatchers give CPR instructions
  during cardiac arrest calls.
