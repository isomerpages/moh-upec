<p>The Joint ITE-UPEC Certificate in Pre-hospital Emergency Care Course allows
both local and foreign paramedics to be recognised as qualified paramedics
under the EAS and MTS regulations. Current paramedics must take and pass
the recertification test every two years.</p>
<h4>Course Information</h4>
<p>The course starts with a five-week self-directed learning phase, where
participants will complete online quizzes and participate in discussions.
This is followed by a 3-day face-to-face (F2F) session at ITE College East.
The third day of the F2F session will include both theory and practical
assessments. To successfully complete the course, participants must attend
the required F2F sessions and pass both assessments. Additionally, a course
briefing will be held, during which textbooks will be provided to participants
for the course duration.</p>
