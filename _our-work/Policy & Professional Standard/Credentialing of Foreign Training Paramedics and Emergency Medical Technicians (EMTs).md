# Credentialing Framework for Foreign-Trained Paramedics & Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs)
# 

MOH will be regulating Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) and Medical Transport Service (MTS) as healthcare services under the new Healthcare Services Act (HCSA). The MOH 2017 Standards for EAS and MTS also define the staff requirements in terms of recognised qualifications and certifications.

The credentialing framework allows Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) / Paramedics who were trained overseas to be recognised as qualified EMTs / Paramedics. The eligibility criteria as well as the requirement are appended below:

To ensure that the quality of overseas-trained Paramedics and EMTs practising in Singapore remain high, you may refer to the list of recognised foreign paramedic qualifications. The list is reviewed from time to time.

Applications are reviewed by UPEC with an estimated turnaround time of 3-4 weeks. UPEC will inform you of the outcome of the application.
