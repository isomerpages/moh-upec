<p>Healthcare Services Act (HCSA), slated to be implemented in 2022, will
be replacing the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PMHCA) where
regulatory compliances go according to the nature and type of services
provided over premise based licensing. More information about HCSA are
available at this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/hcsa/home" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p>In the new regulatory framework, under HCSA, all private ambulance services
will need to be licensed. The Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs) will be
required to apply for a HCSA license in order to provide either Emergency
Ambulance Service (EAS) or Medical Transport Service (MTS).</p>
<p>UPEC is working closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop a
set of relevant and updated standards for both EAS and MTS; that will be
enforced under the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA).</p>
<p>Each vehicle must meet the licensing requirement and be issued with a
Certificate of Compliance (COC). The issuance of the COC will supersede
the current Letter of Support (LOS) Scheme. Vehicles issued with a COC
will continue to enjoy tax exemptions.</p>
<h3>Requirements for Accreditation</h3>
<p>We strongly encouraged existing and new Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs)
to accredit their fleet as well as comply with the MOH 2017 Standards for
Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) and Medical Transport Service (MTS).

</p>
<p>PAOs that are unable to meet the licensing requirements by the time regulations
are enforced will not be able to provide EAS or MTS services.</p>
