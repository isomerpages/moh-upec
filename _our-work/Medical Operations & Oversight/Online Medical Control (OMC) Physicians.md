<p>Paramedics perform medical interventions strictly according to written
protocols. However, there are rare incidents where written protocols may
not best serve the patients. EMS-trained Emergency Physicians (EPs) are
scheduled by UPEC to be on standby around the clock, 24 hours a day, to
provide clinical advice to SCDF paramedics. The EPs are from UPEC and other
MOH units.</p>
<p>With the increasing demand in healthcare, just dispatching ambulances
from the 995 operations center is no longer sufficient. During critical
situations, medical instructions can be given over the phone to the patient
or bystanders. Starting with Dispatcher-Assisted CPR for cardiac arrest
patients by medical dispatch nurses seconded since 2014, they have now
expanded the medical telephone instructions to callers for many other medical
conditions.</p>
