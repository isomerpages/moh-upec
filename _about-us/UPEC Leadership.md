**Foreword by Clinical Director**

Our vision is for Singapore to possess a world-class PEC system, readily accessible to all, and providing excellent patient outcomes. In order to achieve this, we need to develop a coherent and viable framework for inter-agency collaboration and coordination in the long-term development of PEC in Singapore, promote public responsiveness in pre-hospital emergencies, strengthen Singapore’s PEC Services to world-class standards and ensure that PEC is seamlessly integrated into the health care system. We also aim to create a supportive environment for research into PEC to improve health outcomes.

Let’s work together to improve PEC in Singapore!
