<p>With endorsement from the Ministry of Health, the National Targeted Temperature
Management (TTM) Workgroup was established in 2014 under the Unit for Prehospital
Emergency Care (UPEC) to promote TTM as a standard of care for post-cardiac
arrest management in Singapore, aiming to improve the survival and neurological
outcomes of cardiac arrest patients.</p>
<p>Over the years, the workgroup has played a pivotal role in advancing post-cardiac
arrest care, including TTM, in Singapore. With diverse representation from
various healthcare institutions and across different specialties, the workgroup
has developed local post-cardiac arrest guidelines based on the latest
evidence, conducted local research projects, collaborated with international
resuscitation organizations, and held numerous educational courses for
local and regional healthcare providers. The workgroup drafted the national
TTM guideline, which was published in the Singapore Medical Journal in
July 2017.</p>
<p>Recognizing the growing importance of post-resuscitation care for cardiac
arrest patients, the workgroup was renamed in 2024 to the National Post
Cardiac Arrest and Survivorship (PCAS) Workgroup to better reflect its
broadened scope and enhanced mission.</p>
