<p>The Healthcare Services Bill was passed in the Singapore Parliament in
2020 to gradually replace the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act
(PHMCA). The Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) aims to enhance patient safety
and well-being while enabling the Ministry of Health (MOH) to adopt a more
flexible approach to regulating the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape.</p>
<p>The HCSA introduces a service-based licensing framework, allowing healthcare
providers to obtain licenses based on the specific services they offer,
unlike the previous premises-based licensing framework under the PHMCA.
The implementation of the HCSA is divided into three phases: Phase 1 began
in January 2022, followed by Phase 2 in June 2023, and Phase 3 by the end
of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>HCSA Ambulance Regulatory Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>To improve patient care and ensure the safety and welfare of those seeking
ambulance services, all private ambulance services must be licensed under
the HCSA starting from January 3, 2022. Private Ambulance Operators (PAOs)
must apply for an HCSA license to provide either Emergency Ambulance Service
(EAS) or Medical Transport Service (MTS).</p>
<p>The HCSA also introduces the role of the Clinical Governance Officer (CGO).
PAOs must establish a clinical governance framework, including oversight
by a CGO responsible for the clinical and technical aspects of their services.
They must ensure that EAS and MTS crew members have the appropriate training,
skills, and competencies and that vehicles are equipped with the necessary
equipment, medications, and consumables, all in working order and not expired,
as stipulated in the EAS and MTS regulations. MOH will conduct random audits
and compliance checks to ensure ongoing adherence to these requirements.</p>
<p>PAOs that provide EAS and MTS in Singapore without a valid service licence
issued under the HCSA, or use emergency ambulances (EAs) or medical transports
(MTs) not listed as licensed conveyances in their HCSA service licence,
will be in violation of the HCSA.</p>
<p><strong>Licence Conditions for EAS and MTS under the HCSA</strong>
</p>
<p>MOH has developed Licence Conditions (LCs) for Licensees of EAS and MTS
under the HCSA to ensure safe service provision. The EAS LCs and MTS LCs
outline the mandatory requirements for operating an EAS or MTS and are
applicable alongside the relevant regulations under the HCSA, including
the Healthcare Services (General) Regulations, Healthcare Services (Emergency
Ambulance and Medical Transport Service) Regulations, and Healthcare Services
(Advertisement) Regulations.</p>
<p>Licensees must comply with the General Regulations, Advertisement Regulations,
Fees Regulations, and EAS and MTS Regulations under the HCSA. To better
understand the license conditions for EAS and MTS, you may download the
