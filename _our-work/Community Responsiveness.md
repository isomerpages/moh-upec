<p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurs when the heart suddenly stops
beating and happens outside of a hospital. The victim is not responsive
and does not breathe normally. Mortality is usually high and timely intervention,
also known as the ‘Chain of Survival’, is critical to increase the victim’s
chances of survival. In 2020, more than 3,400 OHCA cases happened in Singapore.</p>
<p>During this process, the calling of 995, administering of bystander CPR
and the use of an AED on the victim are interventions that can be performed
by any layperson. The Dispatcher-Assisted first REsponder (or DARE) programme
focuses on educating the public on this life-saving skill.</p>
