<summary><strong>Q: Can a male bystander, who has no relation to the female SCA victim, come to her aid by starting CPR and the using of AED?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes it is alright for a male bystander to dare to
call 995, start CPR and use an AED on a female victim (especially Muslims)
if there is no other female bystander able to do so. This is because the
situation is a desperate emergency case. If there is a female bystander
or passerby, she should assist the male bystander in the resuscitation
in any way possible. The female bystander can also be a witness too. ~ <em>Ustaz Syed Nasir Omar, a religious leader with AlFahmi Services</em>

<summary><strong>Q: Should a female bystander who has no experience in healthcare attempt to resuscitate the SCA victim who may be bigger in size than her?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes we encourage female bystanders to dare to save
a heart even if they are not medically trained or are physically small.
Anybody can call 995. Any chest compression is better than none at all.
Anyone can use an AED as the voice prompts are clear. Do not be afraid
just because you are female; you are equally capable of initiating resuscitation.
~ <em>Dr Karen Soh, Immediate Past President of the Association of Women Doctors, Singapore</em>
