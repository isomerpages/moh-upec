<h1><strong>Pre-hospital Emergency Medical Care (PEMC) Fellowship Programme</strong></h1>
<p>Pre-hospital Emergency Care (PEC) being a uniquely time-sensitive field,
the provision of basic and advanced life support in an out-of-hospital
environment requires the active involvement and insight of Emergency Medicine
physicians.</p>
<p>With the support from MOH, UPEC has launched the first local PEMC Fellowship
Programme since 2014. This initiative not only enhances the quality of
medical care provided and therefore patientsâ€™ outcome, but also nurtures
a pool of Emergency Medicine physicians subspecializing in the pre-hospital
emergency care who would become the leader of this field and look after
the national needs in the long run.</p>
