<p>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating.
The victim is not responsive and does not breathe normally. Mortality is
usually high and timely intervention, also known as the ‘Chain of Survival’,
is critical to increase the victim’s chances of survival. In 2020, more
than 3,400 Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) cases happened in Singapore.</p>
<p>During this process, the calling of 995, administering of bystander CardioPulmonary
Resuscitation (CPR) and the use of an Automated External Defibrillator
(AED) on the victim are interventions that can be performed by any layperson. <strong>CPR awareness and training need to start from the community. We believe it is important to invest in raising the health literacy/awareness of our population, as a long term strategy to improve bystander CPR and cardiac arrest survival in our communities.</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>DARE programme</strong> focuses on educating the public on this
life-saving skill and aims to increase the survival rate of cardiac arrest
from 20% to at least 30%, similar to cities such as Seattle, Tokyo or Seoul
where survival rates range from 30% to 50%.</p>

<summary><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p><strong>Q: Can a male bystander, who has no relation to the female SCA victim, come to her aid by starting CPR and the using of AED? </strong>
<br><strong>A: </strong>Yes it is alright for a male bystander to dare to
call 995, start CPR and use an AED on a female victim (especially Muslims)
if there is no other female bystander able to do so. This is because the
situation is a desperate emergency case. If there is a female bystander
or passerby, she should assist the male bystander in the resuscitation
in any way possible. The female bystander can also be a witness too. ~ <em>Ustaz Syed Nasir Omar, a religious leader with AlFahmi Services</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should a female bystander who has no experience in healthcare attempt to resuscitate the SCA victim who may be bigger in size than her? </strong>
<br><strong>A: </strong>Yes we encourage female bystanders to dare to save
a heart even if they are not medically trained or are physically small.
Anybody can call 995. Any chest compression is better than none at all.
Anyone can use an AED as the voice prompts are clear. Do not be afraid
just because you are female; you are equally capable of initiating resuscitation.
~ <em>Dr Karen Soh, Immediate Past President of the Association of Women Doctors, Singapore</em>
