<p>Therapeutic Temperature Management (TTM) was strongly recommended by the
2015 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) as a component
of post resuscitation care. It has been known to be effective in improving
the survival rate and neurological function outcome of patients after cardiac
arrest.</p>
<p>In 2015, a national workgroup, composed of specialists in Emergency Medicine,
Medical ICU and Cardiology of all restructured hospitals, was formed to
provide oversight of the development of TTM in Singapore. The workgroup
drafted the national TTM guideline and it was published in the Singapore
Medical Journal in Jul 2017. (See Below)</p>
<p>In 2024, the workgroup was renamed to the National Post Cardiac Arrest
and Survivorship (PCAS) Workgroup.</p>
