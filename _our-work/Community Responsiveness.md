<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurs when the heart suddenly stops
beating and happens outside of a hospital. The victim is not responsive
and does not breathe normally. Mortality is usually high and timely intervention,
also known as the ‘Chain of Survival’, is critical to increase the victim’s
chances of survival. In 2020, more than 3,400 OHCA cases happened in Singapore.</p>
<p>During this process, the calling of 995, administering of bystander CPR
and the use of an AED on the victim are interventions that can be performed
by any layperson. CPR awareness and training need to start from the community.
We believe it is important to invest in raising the health literacy/awareness
of our population, as a long term strategy to improve bystander CPR and
cardiac arrest survival in our communities.</p>
<p>The <strong>DARE programme</strong> focuses on educating the public on this
life-saving skill and aims to increase the survival rate of cardiac arrest
from 20% to at least 30%, similar to cities such as Seattle, Tokyo or Seoul
where survival rates range from 30% to 50%.</p>
